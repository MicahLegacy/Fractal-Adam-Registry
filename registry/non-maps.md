# Non-Maps Ledger (Pluralism Failures / Partial Fits)

This ledger records mapping attempts that **failed** (or only partially fit), so pluralism cannot be forced.

**Purpose:** Prevent “everything maps” inflation.  
**Not a weapon:** Do not use entries to attack traditions or people.  
**Integrity rule:** A Non-Map verdict is an allowed outcome. It narrows scope and prevents coercive synthesis.

## Status Legend
- **NON-MAP** = mapping fails under the stated protocol
- **PARTIAL MAP** = some fit, but core mismatch remains (scope must be narrowed)
